## ðŸ“œ About the Project

This project is inspired by the **Siamese Neural Network architecture**, as described in the paper:

> Koch, Gregory. *"Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition."* ICML Deep Learning Workshop (2015).

Siamese networks learn to compare image pairs by producing embeddings and minimizing the distance between similar 
faces while maximizing the distance between different faces.

This notebook (`SetUp.ipynb`) helps create the required dataset for such models by capturing images via a webcam and
organizing them into appropriate folders for training.
